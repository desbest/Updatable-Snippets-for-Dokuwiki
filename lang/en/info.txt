This tool should  reconcile any differences between the metafiles, the pages, and the database.
It compares the snippets found in the page files against the snippets logged in their metafiles, and then updates the metafiles to reflect the contents of the pages. 
It also updates the database which holds two lists:
    - pages which have snippets and which snippets
    - snippets and the pages they are embedded in
